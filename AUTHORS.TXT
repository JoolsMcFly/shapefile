Currently I'm the only developer (ovidio AT users.sourceforge.net). I implemented the 2D variants of the ShapeFile
format as defined in http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf. The library currently
supports reading and editing of ShapeFiles and the Associated information (DBF file). There are a lot of things
that can be improved in the code, if you are interested in developing, helping with the
documentation, making translations or offering new ideas please contact me (ovidio AT users.sourceforge.net).
